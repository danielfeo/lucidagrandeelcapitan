**Check out the updated version for MacOS made by my partner Kay Yin: https://github.com/HiKay/macOSLucidaGrande**


**ATTENTION! - There are issues that we (apparently) can't work around at this time.**

A small Apple Automator application which makes it possible to use the traditional Mac OS X system-font "Lucida Grande" on OS X 10.11 El Capitan.
